#welcome user and give instructions

print(r'''Welcome to my very basic Comp TIA Security+ Readiness Evaluation. This test 
      was designed to evaluate if you are ready to take the exam. There are 5 levels ranging
      from easiest to hardest. The first three levels focus on basics and memorization orientated
      questions, while the last two focus on concepts and word problems that are more in line 
      with actual questions from the exam.

      There will be ten multiple choice questions. Unlike the exam you will have three 
      answers to choose from. Make you selection by entering just the letter of the 
      selection you believe is correct. At the end of the test you will be given a score,
      but will also have immediate feedback. 

      This is level 2. If you get ANY of these wrong. You have more
      studying to do before you even look at their website.
